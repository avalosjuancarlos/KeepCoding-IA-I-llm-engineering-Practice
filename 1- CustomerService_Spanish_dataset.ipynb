We use the [\"bitext/Bitext-customer-support-llm-chatbot-training-dataset\"](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bitext/Bitext-customer-support-llm-chatbot-training-dataset), ideal for training Large Language Models (LLMs) in intent detection and domain adaptation.\n","\n","For translation, we employ the [\"Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-tc-big-en-es\"](https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-tc-big-en-es) model from Hugging Face. This neural machine translation model is designed to translate from English to Spanish. It is part of the OPUS-MT project, aiming to make neural translation models accessible for many languages. These models are originally trained with Marian NMT and converted to PyTorch using Hugging Face's transformers library. Training data comes from OPUS.\n","\n","Dataset base details:\n","\n","- Use: Intent Detection in Customer Service.\n","- Contains 27 intents grouped into 10 categories.\n","- Includes 26872 question-answer pairs, about 1000 per intent.\n","- Features 30 entity/slot types and 12 types of language generation tags.\n","- The categories and intents are selected from Bitext's collection covering various sectors.\n","\n","This dataset is characterized by its hybrid approach in generating question-answer pairs, combining natural texts, natural language processing (NLP) technology to extract seeds from these texts, and natural language generation (NLG) technology to expand seed texts. The entire process is overseen by computational linguists.\n","\n","Once the dataset is translated, we upload it to Hugging Face for use in our model training or fine-tuning."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7088,"status":"ok","timestamp":1718384653805,"user":{"displayName":"juan
