This model is an adaptation of the projecte-aina/FLOR-1.3B, first finetuned to be more instructed as a Customer Service chatbot and later optimized with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and Langchain. It takes advantage of the transformer-based architecture of FLOR-1.3B-customerservice for text generation in Spanish and enriches it with external knowledge sources to achieve context-aware results. Key components include dependency installation, efficient model loading, conversational prompts, text retrieval embeddings, and a customized chatbot named Firulais, designed to provide specific company support. This setup demonstrates a seamless integration of language modeling, retrieval, and conversational AI.\n","\n","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method that combines the power of transformer-based language models with the ability to query external databases to enhance the quality and factual accuracy of the generated text. Langchain is a framework designed to facilitate the integration of language models with external knowledge sources, such as databases and APIs, allowing for more informed and context-aware text generation. FLOR-1.3B-customerservice, a derivative of BLOOM, is a multi-lingual, transformer-based causal language model specifically tuned for Catalan, Spanish, and English. It was developed by adapting the vocabulary and embedding layer of the original model and further pre-training it on a massive corpus of 140B tokens in the target languages. Although primarily intended for causal language modeling, FLOR-1.3B's architecture allows it to be readily applied to text generation tasks and can be further fine-tuned for specific applications. The combination of RAG with Langchain and leveraging the capabilities of FLOR-1.3B provides a robust framework for generating contextually rich and accurate language outputs.\n","\n","---\n","---\n","\n","\n","- More info about RAG: [Link](https://ai.meta.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models/)\n","\n","- More info about the Framework Langchain: [Link](https://www.langchain.com/)\n","\n","- More info about FLOR-1.3B-customerservice: [Link](https://huggingface.co/ericrisco/flor-1-3B-customerservice)\n","\n","- More info about \"Projecte AINA\": [Link](https://projecteaina.cat/)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"aZX5ZkrTtrig"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Installing dependencies"],"metadata":{"id":"NHKldp0Uy6bj"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"Fog_oC-ZDTOe","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718416570904,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":16152,"user":{"displayName":"juan carlos avalos","userId":"04995870806901304860"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["!pip install -qU bitsandbytes datasets accelerate loralib peft transformers trl langchain sentence-transformers faiss-gpu"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Imports and device prep\n","\n","This code sets up an environment for language models, particularly for conversation and retrieval-augmented generation.
